- Start of Session: ALWAYS read .cursor/PRD.md and all files in .cursor/memory/ to orient yourself.

- Workflow:

  - PLAN: Propose changes and update the task list in progress.md.

  - ACT: Execute the code changes after approval.

- Persistence: After every significant change, update .cursor/memory/activeContext.md and .cursor/memory/progress.md.
