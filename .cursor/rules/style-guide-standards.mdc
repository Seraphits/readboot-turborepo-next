ReadBoot Style Guide & Pattern Lab Standards
1. Documentation Philosophy
Intent: Function as a "System-First Instructional Manual" for experienced React developers.

Strategy: Focus strictly on implementation logic, semantic guardrails, and accessibility.

Tone: Neutral and competent technical instruction.

Constraint: No gamification (badges, completion tracking).

2. Information Architecture (Tree Structure)
Documentation in apps/docs must mirror the @repo/ui filesystem hierarchy.

Component Hierarchy
Each folder acts as a parent node:

LayoutAtoms/: Foundational elements (Box, Prose, SectionLayout).

Molecules/: Functional groups (BouncyCTA, GlitchHeader, Masthead).

Organisms/: Complex UI sections.

Templates/: Page-level skeletons.

Styles Hierarchy
Abstracts/: Functions, Mixins, and Semantic Token Variables.

Base/: Resets, global animations, and primary typography.

Other/: Catch-all for specialized styles that fall outside abstracts/base (e.g., typography.scss overrides).

3. Pattern Lab Page Requirements
Every component page must include these four text-based modules:

How to Use: Text-only instructions on React implementation.

Interactive Preview: Live playground using nuqs for linkable URL states.

Accessibility Notes: Keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, and WCAG targets.

Dos and Don'ts: Guardrails to prevent design debt and ensure consistency.

4. Technical Implementation Rules
State Management: Use useQueryState from nuqs for all component modifiers.

Naming: Strict BEM convention without custom prefixes (e.g., .card, .card__title).

Styling: SCSS Modules only. Variables must be sourced from abstracts/, never hardcoded.
