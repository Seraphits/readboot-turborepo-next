# Monorepo Architecture Rules
- **Structure:** apps/ contains deployable services; packages/ contains shared libraries. [3]
- **Package Manager:** Always use pnpm. Never use npm or yarn. [4]
- **Internal Dependencies:** Use the workspace:* protocol for all internal package references. [5]
- **Task Execution:** Use pnpm --filter <package-name> <command> to leverage Turborepo's caching. [6, 7]
